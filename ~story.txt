This is a story a man named Jake. Jake wanted to go UW Madison. But he 
had not good gpa. So he studied hard. Then he can get permission.

Jake's hard work got him into UW-Madison. Now he needs to keep working hard 
to get good grades during his college career. He will have a lot of new 
expierences, some good, some bad, but overall he thinks college will be a good
time.

Jake decides to take a class called Introduction to Potato studies. Potato studies 
seemed like an interesting topic because potatoes are delicious, and they are the most
versatile food in the whole world. They can be frid, mashed, baked, made into alcohol, 
and they can even power a clock. Potato studies would prove to be a great choice.

Fortunatly computer science and potatoes are very simliar, sometimes people even can 
even use poatoes as a substiute for CPUs. Infact UW Madison's educational website 
"Canvas" occasionally uses these versitle vegtables. Jake would take up the oppotunity 
to study computer science alongside potates.
